	Abstract = {The delivery of healthcare services has experienced tremendous changes during the last years. Mobile health or mHealth is a key engine of advance in the forefront of this revolution. Although there exists a growing development of mobile health applications, there is a lack of tools specifically devised for their implementation. This work presents mHealthDroid, an open source Android implementation of a mHealth Framework designed to facilitate the rapid and easy development of mHealth and biomedical apps. The framework is particularly planned to leverage the potential of mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets, wearable sensors and portable biomedical systems. These devices are increasingly used for the monitoring and delivery of personal health care and wellbeing. The framework implements several functionalities to support resource and communication abstraction, biomedical data acquisition, health knowledge extraction, persistent data storage, adaptive visualization, system management and value-added services such as intelligent alerts, recommendations and guidelines. An exemplary application is also presented along this work to demonstrate the potential of mHealthDroid. This app is used to investigate on the analysis of human behavior, which is considered to be one of the most prominent areas in mHealth. An accurate activity recognition model is developed and successfully validated in both offline and online conditions.},

	abstract="Automated activity recognition enables a wide variety of applications related to child and elderly care, disease diagnosis and treatment, personal health or sports training, for which it is key to seamlessly determine and log the user's motion. This work focuses on exploring the use of smartphones to perform activity recognition without interfering in the user's lifestyle. Thus, we study how to build an activity recognition system to be continuously executed in a mobile device in background mode. The system relies on device's sensing, processing and storing capabilities to estimate significant movements/postures (walking at different paces---slow, normal, rush, running, sitting, standing). In order to evaluate the combinations of sensors, features and algorithms, an activity dataset of 16 individuals has been gathered. The performance of a set of lightweight classifiers (Na{\"i}ve Bayes, Decision Table and Decision Tree) working on different sensor data has been fully evaluated and optimized in terms of accuracy, computational cost and memory fingerprint. Results have pointed out that a priori information on the relative position of the mobile device with respect to the user's body enhances the estimation accuracy. Results show that computational low-cost Decision Tables using the best set of features among mean and variance and considering all the sensors (acceleration, gravity, linear acceleration, magnetometer, gyroscope) may be enough to get an activity estimation accuracy of around 88 {\%} (78 {\%} is the accuracy of the Na{\"i}ve Bayes algorithm with the same characteristics used as a baseline). To demonstrate its applicability, the activity recognition system has been used to enable a mobile application to promote active lifestyles.",

abstract={In this paper we present our submission to the AAIA'16 Data Mining Challenge, where the objective was to predict dangerous seismic events based on hourly aggregated readings from different sensor and recent mining expert assessment of the conditions in the mine. During the course of the competition we have exploited a framework for automatic feature extraction from time series data that did not require any manual tuning. Furthermore, we have analyzed the impact of overlapping of input data on model robustness. We argue that training an ensemble of classifiers with distinct (i.e. non-overlapping) chronological data rather than one classifier with all available data can produce more reliable and robust prediction models. By doing that, we were able to avoid overfitting and obtain the same score performance on the evaluation and test datasets, despite the significant data drift in the datasets.},

abstract={One of the main goals of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is to provide supportive environment for the elderly or disabled. Such environments are not feasible without correctly identifying states and activities of the persons receiving the care. They rely on the interaction and processing of data originating from many components and objects in the surrounding. In order to collect the data, various sensors are used to monitor the environment, as well as the person's health parameters. One of the main concerns in AAL is preservation of user's privacy. In this paper we address that by proposing a non-intrusive approach for data collection and identification of daily activity and risks. We describe the wiring of such system based on cheap non-intrusive sensors, deployment in a real environment, the protocols for data fusion and processing, and explain how machine learning could be employed for detecting risks and activities. The main contribution of this paper is development of non-intrusive sensor kits that can be easily deployed in real-life environments and are capable of collecting data that can reliable detect activities and risk.},

abstract="Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",
